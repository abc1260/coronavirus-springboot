What Do We Want From the CoronaService Data Access?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are reading this data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). These are the colum data:
    Province/State
    Country/Region
    Last Update
    Confirmed
    Deaths
    Recovered
    Latitude
    Longitude

I should have ask that question first:
"What Do We Want From the CoronaService Data Access?"

But this started by watching the news, and the news castor said that JHU captures
the CoronaVirus data. Ummm I said. Data and Jhipster magically popped up.

What if I accessed this JHU data using Jhipster. 
What's my motivation, a TV new to create access to CoronaVirus data.


I Ask Again "What Do We Want From the CoronaService Data Access?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the wish list:
Get the date when the data was loaded.
Get a list of CoronaVirus data per region or country.
Get a list of all the CoronaViruses for all and per region or country.

What method access should we use:
    public String getDateLoaded();
    public List<CoronaVirus> getCoronaVirusList();
    public List<CoronaVirus> getCoronaVirusByRegion(String region);
    public Map<String, List<CoronaVirus>> getCoronaVirusRegionsMap();
    public Set<String> getRegionKeys();     


* Explained
-----------------
This will implement: Get the date the data was loaded:
    public String getDateLoaded();

This will implement: Get a list of CoronaVirus data per region/country.
    public List<CoronaVirus> getCoronaVirusByRegion(String region);

This will implement: Get a list of all the CoronaViruses.
    public List<CoronaVirus> getCoronaVirusList();

Cache the list of CoronaVirus per region/country:
    public Map<String, List<CoronaVirus>> getCoronaVirusRegionsMap();

Since we are getting the Map of region enties, get the keys:
    public Set<String> getRegionKeys();
